# MvDevsUnion

## What is MvDevsUnion?
MvDevsUnion is a community-driven union focused on protecting privacy, accountability, and worker rights in the Maldives. It exists because technology is advancing faster than legislation can keep up, creating real risks for privacy, job security, and public understanding.

## Who is it for?
MvDevsUnion is open to everyone. You do not need to be a developer to join. Anyone who cares about worker rights, privacy, and responsible technology can contribute their skills, experience, or perspective.

## Core Values
- **Privacy** - Data protection and user safety come first.
- **Accountability** - Transparency from both institutions and technology builders.

## Scope
Maldives only. The union works specifically on issues that affect Maldivians, local workers, and local digital systems.

## What the union does
- Lobby and advocate for stronger data protection and digital rights.
- Build apps and tools that help citizens understand issues and report problems.
- Create open platforms that encourage transparency and civic awareness.

## Governance
MvDevsUnion is currently represented and led by Fishie, who acts as the union's main representative and lobbyist. Governance is intentionally lightweight and trust-based.

## Public Stance
The primary and non-negotiable goal is ensuring strong data protection for Maldivians.

## What Success Looks Like
Developers who feel empowered, protected, and unafraid to speak up without the fear of losing their jobs for doing the right thing.

## Projects

### Company Watch (Good-and-Naughty)
Started because job listings must have salary listed. Users submit bad listings via a form, union members verify, and results are published. Grew into a directory of verified malpractice including unpaid labor and missing pension contributions.

### Have I Been Pwned MV
Addresses the lack of breach disclosure transparency. All verified data leaks are published showing which companies leaked data and what was exposed. Led to the National Cyber Security Agency creating an official bug bounty program.

### Adheeb Files (Bro Suite)
When the Adheeb files were leaked as a hard-to-read PDF, devs built tools (SMS viewer, notes visualizer, location mapper, chat viewer) to make the data accessible. Used to investigate murder cases and look up corrupt officials.

### Olhu Hiyaa Investigation
A website to visualize findings from a report by animal NGOs on a government-run cat shelter's lack of transparency.

### CTRLehNukureveyne
Built when the government tried to pass a media control bill. The site outlines issues with the bill, explains how people can help, and includes an email helper for one-click messages to the parliament committee.

### Citizen Petition (WPetition)
Parliament's promised e-petition system relies on the hard-to-use eFaas app and has been delayed. This site collects signatures digitally in an easy-to-print format, functioning like a classic paper petition.
